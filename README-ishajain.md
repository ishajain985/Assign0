# Isha Jain

Hi! I’m Isha, a junior from Delhi studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science! I’m most excited by interdisciplinary work that combines software, hardware, and social good — especially projects where technical systems are built with real users, physical constraints, and contexts in mind.

A lot of my work sits at the boundary between computation and the physical world. I enjoy designing systems where sensing, algorithms, and interfaces come together, and where technical decisions directly shape how people learn or interact. I’m drawn to projects that require both engineering rigor and thoughtful design, rather than purely abstract problem-solving.

## Technical Skills
- **Programming:** Python, C++, C#, MATLAB
- **Systems & Interaction:** Unity, OpenCV, BLE communication, real-time signal processing
- **Embedded & Hardware:** Arduino, ESP32, sensors, rotary encoders, potentiometers
- **Design & Prototyping:** CAD (Fusion 360), rapid prototyping, physical computing

## Some Projects & Research
- **XR Microscope** — Built an interactive microscope system that integrates physical controls with a Unity-based visualization pipeline. Implemented BLE communication from embedded hardware to software, mapping sensor input to zoom, focus, and depth-of-field effects using OpenCV.
- **Personalized Learning Platform** — Designed a sequential decision-making system for adaptive instruction, modeling learner knowledge states and selecting actions to maximize information gain.
- **Kiara Kits** — Developed low-cost, hands-on STEM learning kits in collaboration with educators and community partners, focusing on manufacturability, classroom usability, and learning through making.
- **Design for Extreme Affordability (Coral Chicas & Coral Club, Costa Rica)** — Co-designed a coral restoration education and monitoring program in partnership with Costa Rica Coral Restoration, working with local women divers (Coral Chicas) and a youth Coral Club to design hands-on learning activities, community engagement structures, and low-cost monitoring practices.
- **Research Experience** — Projects with the Lifelong Kindergarten group and the Morphing Space Structures Lab, spanning creative learning tools, physical prototyping, and interactive systems.
- **Coral Reef Detection System** — Built a computer vision–based pipeline for monitoring coral reefs, combining image processing and classification to support conservation efforts.

Looking forward to learning and building together!!
